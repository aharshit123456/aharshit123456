### Upcoming projects:

- **Period Tracker (Mo Tracker)** : An ML based Period Tracker that prioritises Data Security
- **Neuroscience related project ** : Gonna be learning different aspects of Computational Neurosciences for my planned work at GSOC 2024 in relation to HNN or Neurodenerative Disorder Diagnosis Assistance

**All the apps mentioned above will also include dark mode with other personalized UI** for succesfully implementing the UTAUT2 model.

### Projects I have worked on

- **Portfolio App** : It allows users to create a social media profile for showcasing their talents.

- **Shotes** : An app that initially started as a means to share and access notes but later evolved into an online social app for education for schools and colleges. Only UI/UX, implementation incomplete.

- **Android Apps for Portfolio** :
  1. **Instagram Clone**
  2. **To-do List App**
  3. **Calculator**

- **Project Chisel** : It allows users to engage in workouts and fitness while also socializing. Currenly the app has been taken down to add better features. I am also looking into adding an AR + AI driven service which allows users to see the form and method to do a certain exercise by just pointing their cameras at it.

Update: Dropped the project after experimenting multiple features on it and loosing interest.
